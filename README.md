# CollisionDetectionSystem
It is used to detect a collision and send the rescue signals to the nearest rescuing department after the collision of the vehicle has happened. It is made using Embedded C programming of the NodeMCU ESP8266, along with Vibration Sensor, buzzer, GPS module, 4x Relay module.

A collision detection system experiment typically involves testing the 
effectiveness and accuracy of a collision detection algorithm or technology. The 
purpose is to evaluate the system's ability to detect and respond to potential 
collisions between objects or vehicles. Here's a general outline of what the 
experiment might involve and the expected results:
Experimental Setup: The experiment would involve setting up a controlled 
environment or scenario where collisions can be simulated. This may include 
using physical objects, virtual simulations, or a combination of both.
Collision Scenarios: Various collision scenarios would be created, representing 
different real-world situations. For example, head-on collisions, rear-end 
collisions, or collisions at intersections. These scenarios would be designed to 
test the system's ability to detect collisions accurately.
Data Collection: Sensors or detectors integrated into the collision detection 
system would capture relevant data during the experiment. This may include 
position, velocity, acceleration, and other parameters of the objects or vehicles 
involved.
System Performance Evaluation: The collected data would be analyzed to 
evaluate the system's performance. Key metrics for evaluation may include 

detection accuracy, response time, false positive/negative rates, and the system's 
ability to handle various collision scenarios.
Comparison with Ground Truth: The experimental results would be compared 
against a ground truth or known outcomes to assess the accuracy of the collision 
detection system. This may involve using reference data or independent 
measurement systems to validate the system's performance.
Optimization and Improvement: Based on the experiment's results, any 
identified limitations or areas for improvement in the collision detection system 
would be addressed. This may involve refining algorithms, adjusting sensor 
placements, or enhancing system parameters to enhance accuracy and 
performance.
The expected results of a collision detection system experiment would vary 
depending on the specific technology, algorithm, or system being tested. The 
experiment aims to provide insights into the system's effectiveness in accurately 
detecting collisions and responding appropriately to mitigate potential risks.
It's important to note that real-world performance may differ from experimental 
results, as the experiment is typically conducted in a controlled environment. 
Factors such as environmental conditions, sensor limitations, and unpredictable 
human behavior can impact the system's performance in actual deployment 
scenarios
